      "content": "Willing Hands uses an open, relaxed posture to reduce resistance and help your body shift from tension to calm. By opening your hands—palms up or forward, depending on whether you're sitting, standing, or lying down—you signal your brain to soften anger and frustration. This simple posture interrupts physical tension and supports acceptance during emotionally intense moments."

Using Willing Hands, they placed their arms by their sides with palms up, relaxed their fingers, and took slow breaths. As they softened the physical tension and reminded themselves, \"I don't need to control everything right now,\" the frustration eased and they became calm enough to rest."
