      "content": "STOP is a crisis skill that helps you pause before acting on intense emotions. The steps are: **Stop** (freeze and don't react), **Take a step back** (physically or mentally), **Observe** your thoughts, feelings, and body sensations without judgment, and **Proceed** mindfully, choosing an action that aligns with your values—not your impulses. STOP creates space between emotion and action, helping you avoid impulsive decisions during moments of anger, panic, or overwhelm."

      "content": "Sky felt a strong urge to engage in harmful eating behaviors after a stressful day. Using STOP, they froze, stepped away from the kitchen, and observed their racing thoughts and tight chest without judgment. Then they chose to text a friend and journal instead of acting on the urge. This helped Sky break the cycle and cope in a healthier way."
