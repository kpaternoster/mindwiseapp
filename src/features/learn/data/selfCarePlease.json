      "content": "PLEASE helps you check basic physical needs that affect your emotional balance. It stands for: Physical illness, Eating well, Avoiding mood-altering substances, Sleep, and Exercise. When these areas are neglected, emotions feel harder to manage and decisions become tougher. Taking care of these basics builds a steadier foundation for handling stress and regulating emotions."
