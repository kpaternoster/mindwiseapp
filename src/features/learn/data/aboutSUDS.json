      "content": "SUDS (Subjective Units of Distress Scale) measures how intense your distress feels on a 1-10 scale. It helps you track your emotions, notice patterns, and know when to use coping skills before things get overwhelming. Regular check-ins increase self-awareness and make it easier to communicate your distress level and ask for support when you need it."

      "content": "Maria saw her friends hanging out without her online and felt a rush of rejection. She paused, rated her distress as 7/10, and used a few quick skills—deep breaths and some movement—to calm her body. When she checked again, she was at 5/10. From that steadier place, she reached out to her friends with curiosity instead of hurt."
