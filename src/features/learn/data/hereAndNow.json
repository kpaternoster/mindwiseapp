      "content": "Here & Now helps you pause, ground yourself, and fully arrive in the present moment. It guides you to focus on your surroundings or sensations so you can step out of rumination and reconnect with what's actually happening. This skill reduces overwhelm, increases clarity, and strengthens mindful awareness."
