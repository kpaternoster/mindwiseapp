      "title": "About Different Action",
      "content": "Different Action helps disrupt emotional distress by choosing behaviors opposite to what your emotions urge you to do. Instead of isolating, you reach out; instead of giving up, you take one small step; instead of lashing out, you act with kindness. By changing your actions, you shift your emotional state. This skill is especially useful for breaking patterns like avoidance, rumination, or destructive urges."

      "content": "Drew felt insecure about attending a student activism event and wanted to stay home. Using Different Action, they recognized the urge to avoid and chose the opposite: they got dressed, went to the event, asked questions, and took notes. Even though it felt uncomfortable at first, Drew ended up feeling proud, learned a lot, and felt more connected to the cause."
