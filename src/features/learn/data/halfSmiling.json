      "content": "Half-Smiling uses a gentle, subtle smile to help shift your body and mind from tension toward calm. By slightly lifting the corners of your mouth—not forcing a grin—you activate your brain's soothing responses, lowering stress and increasing openness. It's especially helpful when you feel angry, resistant, or overwhelmed, because it uses your body to support emotional regulation and acceptance without pretending to be happy."

Using Half-Smile, they took a deep breath, softened their face, and gently lifted the corners of their lips while reminding themselves, \"I don't have to agree, but I can stay calm.\" This helped them remain composed and kept the situation from escalating."
