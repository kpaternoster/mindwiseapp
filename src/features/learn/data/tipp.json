      "content": "TIPP helps you calm your body quickly during emotional overwhelm by changing your physical state. TIPP stands for Temperature, Intense Exercise, Paced Breathing, and Progressive Muscle Relaxation. Temperature means using cold water or ice to shock your system. Intense Exercise involves quick bursts of physical activity to release tension. Paced Breathing helps regulate your nervous system through controlled breathing. Progressive Muscle Relaxation involves tensing and releasing muscle groups. Together, these techniques regulate your nervous system and prevent impulsive reactions."

She used TIPP: Temperature by splashing cold water on her face, Intense Exercise by doing jumping jacks in the restroom, Paced Breathing by counting her breaths, and Progressive Muscle Relaxation by tensing and releasing her shoulders. Within minutes, her body calmed down, and she could return to the meeting feeling more in control."
