      "content": "TIPP helps quickly calm your body during intense emotional overwhelm by targeting your physical state. It stands for **Temperature** (using cold or warmth to shift your system), **Intense Exercise** (brief movement to release stress), **Paced Breathing** (slow, controlled breaths), and **Progressive Muscle Relaxation** (tensing and releasing muscles). These techniques rapidly regulate your nervous system and are especially useful in crisis moments to prevent impulsive reactions."

      "title": "Example",
      "content": "Beck felt a panic attack rising during an argument—tight chest, fast thoughts, shallow breathing. Using TIPP, they stepped away, used something cold on their face (Temperature), did quick burpees (Intense Exercise), slowed their breathing (Paced Breathing), and released muscle tension (Progressive Muscle Relaxation). This helped Beck break the panic cycle and regain enough calm to handle the situation effectively."
