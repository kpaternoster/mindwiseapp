      "content": "Interpersonal Effectiveness Goals help you clarify what you want from any interaction. There are four types of goals:\n\n• Objective Effectiveness: What outcome do you want?\n• Relationship Effectiveness: What do you want for the relationship from this interaction?\n• Self-Respect: How do you want to feel about yourself afterward?\n• Relationship Mindfulness: What do you want to stay aware of about the relationship as you talk?\n\nKnowing your priorities helps you choose the best approach so you can get your needs met, protect the relationship, and feel good about how you handled the situation."

      "content": "Hari faced a conflict between attending his brother’s birthday and going to a concert he’d been excited about. He reviewed his Interpersonal Goals: ideally he wanted both (Objective), he wanted to support his brother (Relationship), and he wanted to be honest while still being a good brother (Self-Respect). Realizing Self-Respect mattered most, he spoke to his brother kindly about the dilemma. His brother asked him to come to the party, so Hari chose to go and watch the concert livestream later. Even without getting the ideal outcome, he felt good about his choice and how he handled the situation."

      "content": "Identify each goal for the situation you are in, then prioritize these goals. Which one is most important, and which one is least. There is no right or wrong here, it's all about figuring out which goals are most important for you in each moment. Lastly, choose how you'd like to respond in this situation based on the goal you deemed most important.",
