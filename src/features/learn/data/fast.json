      "content": "Elaine often felt unheard when Cliff jumped into advice instead of listening. Using FAST, she spoke up fairly (“I know you mean well and want to help”), avoided unnecessary apologies, stayed true to her values (“I need to feel listened to before I can hear solutions”), and was truthful about how his responses affected her. Cliff understood, and Elaine left feeling respected and heard."
