      "content": "Dialectical Thinking helps you hold two truths at the same time instead of seeing things in all-or-nothing terms. It teaches you to replace \"but\" with \"and,\" allowing conflicting experiences to coexist. For example: \"I'm proud of myself, and I can keep growing.\" This shift reduces self-criticism and creates room for both acceptance and improvement."

With Dialectical Thinking, she shifted to \"I'm proud of myself, and I can keep growing.\" This simple change let her feel both satisfied with her efforts and motivated to improve at the same time."
