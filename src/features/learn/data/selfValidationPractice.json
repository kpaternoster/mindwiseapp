Instead of pushing the feeling away or attacking yourself, try to observe your emotions, thoughts, and urges: 'I'm noticing that I'm feeling shame and self-hatred right now. My chest feels tight, and my thoughts are getting really dark.'",

Anyone with my experiences might feel similar.' or 'This self-hatred feels overwhelming right now, and that makes sense given everything I've been through. My feelings are valid responses to real experiences.'",
