      "content": "Check the Facts helps you see whether your emotional reaction matches what's actually happening. It guides you to pause, look at the evidence, consider other explanations, and separate facts from assumptions. This skill reduces distress caused by misinterpretations or past fears and helps you respond more accurately and calmly in difficult situations."

Using Check the Facts, he paused and realized he had added that meaning himself—she was simply making an observation. After a breath, he asked her what she meant and learned she was just making conversation."
